Conversion Rate Analysis
=======

This repo contains the code and data used to produce the graphs + analysis for [this article](www.test.com), which examined the persistence of conversion rates in soccer players using publicly available data. The IPython notebook walks through the code, and the CSV file contains the raw data, plus some variables that didn't enter into the analyis. Feel free to download and play with the data, or try to recreate the stuff that I worked on.

Some of the variables are self explanatory, but in order to clarify some of the ones with less self-evident names:

otrate -- on target rate (shots on target / shots) 	
on_target -- number of shots on target
crate -- conversion rate
in_area -- number of shots from inside the penalty area
out_area -- number of shots from outside the penalty area
in_area_prop -- the proportion of shots take from within the penalty area 
\*_next -- the suffix indicating a stat from 2013
